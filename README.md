# weekends
Inspired by @Tsoding who does recreational rrogramming sessions on Twitch and Youtube.

The plan is to create one small project every weekend which takes 2-10 hours. 
Most of them will be around networking and trying out technology.

Since this is just for fun, and I always have problems with finishing a project after
I reached my main goal, the code can be shit and error handling might be non existing. 
But I will try to not have enormous amounts of memory leaks or completely 
unfinished projects (...).
