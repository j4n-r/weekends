# weekends
Inspired by @Tsoding who does recreational programming sessions on Twitch and Youtube.

The plan is to create one small project every weekend which takes 2-5 hours (if I have the time and nothing else to code). 
Most of them will be around networking and trying out technology.

Since this is just for fun, and I always have problems with finishing a project after
I reached my main goal, the code can be shit and error handling might be non existing. 
But I will try to not have enormous amounts of memory leaks or completely 
unfinished projects (...).

Directory naming:
- {date(YYYY-MM-DD)}\_{language}\_{name}

## Idea list 
- [ ] Networkscaner in Python (UDP)
- [ ] UDP Network scan in C 
- [ ] Packet captue tool with different Network interface support (see "traffic")
- [ ] Real time dashboard in js streaming a data stream (see "traffic")
- [ ] Custom malloc
